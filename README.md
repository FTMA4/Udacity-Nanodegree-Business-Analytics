Udacity Nanodegree Program - Business Analytics 

 

This repository contains my projects submitted for Business Analysis Nanodegree program courses. Through them, I've gained the skills to manipulate, analyze, visualize, and storytelling through data using Excel, use SQL queries to analyze databases and use Tableau to build interactive visualizations through dashboards, where I've learned how to work with data and use them to make informed decisions to solve business problems.

The queries were used to answer multiple questions, after which I reported my findings in a short report combined with visualization.
